Table rate shipping extends WooCommerceâ€™s default shipping options letting you calculate shipping costs based on total price, item count, weight, etc

== Description ==

ðŸ‘‰ [Pro Version](https://wpwax.com/product/easy-table-rate-shipping-pro-for-woocommerce/) | [Documentation](https://wpwax.com/docs/woocommerce-table-rate-shipping/) | [Support](https://wpwax.com/contact/) ðŸ‘ˆ

WooCommerce table rate shipping plugin is the easiest and feature-rich shipping plugin for WooCommerce stores allowing you to calculate shipping costs based on total price, weight, item count, etc. There are many table rate shipping plugins out there but setting conditional shipping rates is not as easy as it is with the WooCommerce Table Rate Shipping plugin. We do not like to scare users with tons of settings and options. We have implemented a very clean and easily-understandable setting panel where a user can easily calculate shipping costs based on multiple criteria.
